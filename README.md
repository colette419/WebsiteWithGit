# WebsiteWithGit
Build a very basic web page. As you go, make commits at the following points:

- After you put in the basic HTML scaffolding (<DOCTYPE html> to </html>)
- After you add some body content
- When you add a stylesheet with some styles
- After you add a navigation bar
- When your project is complete

Make sure to leave descriptive commit messages for each commit!
